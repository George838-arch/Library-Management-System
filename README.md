## 📖Library Management System (C++)📖

A console-based Library Management System developed using **C++** to demonstrate
strong fundamentals in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **file handling**,
and basic **data structures**.  
This project simulates a real-world system with user authentication and role-based access.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The application allows users to register and log in to the system with different
permissions based on their role (Admin or User).  
It focuses on clean code structure, modular design, and applying core software
engineering concepts in C++.

## ✨ Key Features

- User registration and login system  
- Role-based access control (Admin / User)  
- Persistent data storage using file handling  
- Object-Oriented Programming design  
- Console-based interface  
- Organized and readable code structure  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling
- Data Structures
- Git & GitHub

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/George838-arch/Library-Management-System.git
2.g++ main.cpp -o library

3.Run the program:
./library

## 📌 Purpose of the Project:
